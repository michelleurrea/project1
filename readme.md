## How To Play
When you are ready to begin, press the "Amonos" button. This is slang for the term "Vamonos" which means "Let's go" in Spanish. Once you click the button, your gamecard will be displayed and every two seconds, a card will be dealt from the shuffled deck. If the card that is dealt is a match on your gamecard, click on the card to place a bean on the card. If you accidently click on a card, now worries. Clicking on the card once more will allow you to remove the bean. Once all of the spots on your gamecard have a bean on them, you will be allowed to press the "Buenas" button. Clicking the "Buenas" button will then stop dealing cards and let you know if you have indeed won, or if you thought you won, but unfortunately you didn't. If all of the cards have been dealt and you did not press the "Buenas" button, unortunately this probably means you missed matching one of the cards dealt with your gamecard, resulting in you losing the game.

## Objective
As soon as you finish filling out your gamecard, you want to click the "Buenas" button right away.
